A Swift Playground visualizing gravity based on Einstein's Theory of General Relativity

## Introduction

In Newtonian physics, gravity is molded as a force between masses. But the reason of gravitational pull was never explained until Albert Einstein published his theory of general relativity in 1915. According to Einstein: The planets orbit the sun because the mass of sun bends the 4D spacetime around it so the planets move towards the curvature of spacetime it creates.

Itâ€™s very hard for us humans to imagine geometries in 4D space. To help us more intuitively understand the effect of general relativity, I created this playground: It compresses and abstracts the 3D space component of 4D spacetime into a 2D sheet of fabric. The mass of objects curves the imaginary spacetime fabric on screen and the dent of spacetime (mass) attracts other objects nearby.

Learners using this playground can:
1) create their own astronomical objects through coding without breaking the interactive scene
2) easily reposition stars and planets by dragging objects on screen.
3) give planets velocity by flicking planets towards a direction. The right amount of velocity and angle can make planets move in orbit around a star. 
4) The curvature of spacetime fabric is updated in real time to give learners better pictures of the distortion effect of masses. 
5) The user can pitch, zoom in and out the camera at any time using conventional gestures.
