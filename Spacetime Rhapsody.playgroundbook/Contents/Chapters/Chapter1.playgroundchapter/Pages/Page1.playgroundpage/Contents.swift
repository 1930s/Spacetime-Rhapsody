 Here is a simple solar system. What keeps the planets in orbit?
 
 While Newton said it’s because the gravitational force of the sun is pulling the planets towards itself, he never explained why or how does gravity achieve that. Moreover, what is gravity anyway?
 
 This has puzzled all mankind for centuries until Albert Einstein published his theory of general relativity in 1915. According to Einstein: **The planets orbit the sun because the mass of sun bends the 4D [spacetime](glossary://spacetime) around it so the planets move towards the curvature it creates.**
 
 But what does that mean?
 
 Well it’s very hard for us humans to imagine geometries in 4D spaces. To help us better understand the effect of general relativity, **this playground compresses and abstracts the 3D space component of the 4D spacetime into a 2D sheet of fabric.** As you can see, the huge mass of sun curves the spacetime fabric greatly to attract objects around it while other planets create a much smaller dent.
 
 **Adjust** the camera angle by a 2 finger swipe. You can get a clearer view of the curvature if you align the camera underneath the plane of spacetime fabric.
 
 **Zoom** in or out by pinching to get your desired field of view.
 
 You can also **move around** any object in the scene by simply dragging. We’ll explore more of this in the next page.
